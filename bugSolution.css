The issue was caused by a missing unit in the calculation. The corrected code includes 'px' units in the calculation to ensure the values are treated as pixels.

```css
/* Incorrect CSS */
#myElement {
  width: calc(100vw - 20);
}

/* Correct CSS */
#myElement {
  width: calc(100vw - 20px);
}
```
Adding the unit resolves the calculation problem, resulting in the expected width for the element.
